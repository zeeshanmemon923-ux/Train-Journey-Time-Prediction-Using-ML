# Train Journey Time Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete end-to-end Machine Learning project developed during internship.

## Project Overview

The system predicts train journey duration based on:
- Total Distance
- Total Number of Stops

The project follows a structured ML workflow including:

- Data Understanding
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Model Comparison
- Final Interactive GUI Deployment

## Repository Structure

development/
Contains level-wise implementation of the ML workflow.

final_app/
Contains the final GUI-based interactive application.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter
- Pillow

## How to Run

Navigate to final_app folder:

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train model (run once):
   python train_model.py

3. Launch application:
   python gui_app.py
